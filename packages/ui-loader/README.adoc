= Antora UI Loader

The UI loader is a component in Antora responsible for downloading a UI bundle, if necessary, and loading the files into a UI catalog.
The UI files are combined with the content files at the end of the Antora documentation pipeline to produce a complete site.

https://antora.org[Antora] is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
Its site generator pipeline aggregates documents from versioned content repositories and processes them using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].
