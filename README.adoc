{uri-project}[Antora] is a modular, multi-repository site generator designed for creating documentation sites from content composed in AsciiDoc and processed with {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor].

Antora's toolchain and workflow help documentation and engineering teams create, manage, collaborate on, remix, and publish documentation sites sourced from multiple versioned git repositories without needing expertise in web technologies, build automation, or system administration.

This project includes a command line interface (CLI) and a preassembled site generator pipeline so you can quickly start publishing documentation sites with Antora.

== Quickstart

This section offers a basic tutorial for evaluating Antora.
More comprehensive installation instructions are in the {uri-docs}[Antora documentation].

=== Prerequisites

Antora runs on Node 8 (and above).
Antora is verified to work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

To install Antora, you'll need Node 8 (including npm, which is bundled with Node) on your system.
Unless you're using Windows, you'll also need the base build tools for your OS.

Let's start with the build tools, since they're also useful for managing Node.

==== Base Build Tools

The base build tools are required for installing nodegit, a key dependency of Antora, on Linux and macOS.
If you're running Windows, you can skip this section.

If you're running Linux, select the appropriate base build tools package for your distribution.

* Fedora: `dnf install libcurl-devel openssl-devel python`
* Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install build-essential libcurl3-gnutls libssl-dev`
* Arch Linux: `pacman -S base-devel`
* Alpine Linux*: `apk add g++ libressl-dev make python curl-dev`
* RHEL*: `yum install gcc-c++ make openssl-devel libcurl-devel hostname`

{asterisk} To use Antora on Alpine Linux or RHEL, you must force nodegit to be recompiled using BUILD_ONLY=true (see instructions below).

If you're running macOS, you need the https://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html[Xcode command line tools].
Even if you've installed these tools in the past, it's good to do it again.
You can trigger installation using the following command:

 xcode-select --install

This selection of tools provides other useful commands you'll need in your workflow, such as `git`.

Once you have these tools installed, you can expect the remaining installation to go smoothly.

==== Node 8

Antora requires Node 8, the current long-term support (LTS) release of Node.
While you can try Node 9, Antora is not currently tested on it.

To determine which version of Node you have installed, if any, open a terminal and type:

 $ node --version

If this command fails with an error, you don't have Node installed.
If the command doesn't report a Node 8 version (e.g., v{version-node}), you don't have a suitable version of Node installed.

If Node 8 is provided by the package manager for your operating system, we encourage you to install Node that way.
Otherwise, we recommend using {uri-nvm}[nvm] (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node installations.

NOTE: Most CI environments use nvm to install the version of Node used for the build job.
Thus, by using nvm, you closely align your setup with the environment used to generate and publish your production site.

If you're using Linux or macOS, follow {uri-nvm-install}[the nvm installation instructions] to set up nvm on your machine.
If you're using Windows, you can install the {uri-nvm-windows}[Windows port of nvm] via the {uri-choco}[Chocolatey package manager] using `choco install -y nvm`.
Alternatively, you can install the LTS release of Node directly using `choco install -y nodejs-lts`.

Once you've installed nvm, open a *new* terminal and install Node 8 using:

 $ nvm install 8

IMPORTANT: If you're using nvm for Windows, you must enter the full version of Node when running commands (e.g., `nvm install {version-node}`, `nvm use {version-node}`) until {uri-nvm-windows}/issues/214[nvm-windows#214] is resolved.
Run `nvm list available` to see a list of available Node versions.

Switch to this version of Node using the following command:

 $ nvm use 8

To make Node 8 the default in new terminals (Linux and macOS only), type:

 $ nvm alias default 8

Now that you have Node installed, you can proceed with installing Antora.

=== Install Antora

To generate a site with Antora, you need the Antora CLI and an Antora site generator pipeline.
Once these packages are installed, you use the `antora` command to generate your site.

We'll begin by installing the Antora CLI using npm.
You should install this package globally so the `antora` command is always available on your PATH.

In your terminal, type:

 $ npm install -g @antora/cli

NOTE: If you prefer Yarn over npm, you can choose to install Antora using `yarn global add @antora/cli`.

Verify the `antora` command is available on your PATH by running:

 $ antora -v

If the installation worked, this command should complete successfully and report the version of the Antora CLI.

Next, install the default Antora site generator using npm (or Yarn):

 $ npm install -g @antora/site-generator-default

You can opt to install the site generator inside the project containing your playbook file instead of installing it globally.

.Troubleshooting nodegit Installation
[CAUTION]
====
The nodegit dependency may fail on certain Linux distributions with the following error:

....
Error: libcurl-gnutls.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
....

This is an open issue in nodegit.
See https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/issues/1246[nodegit#1246].

If this happens, you either need to create the missing symlink or force nodegit to be recompiled (instead of using a precompiled binary).

To create the missing symlink, run the following command:

 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libcurl.so.4 /usr/lib64/libcurl-gnutls.so.4

or, if that fails:

 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libcurl.so.4 /usr/lib/libcurl-gnutls.so.4

Once you've made that symlink, run the `npm install` command again.

 $ npm install -g @antora/site-generator-default

If you aren't comfortable making a system-wide change, you can instead force nodegit to be recompiled instead by passing the `BUILD_ONLY` environment variable to the `npm install` command.

 $ BUILD_ONLY=true npm install -g @antora/site-generator-default

Be aware that recompiling nodegit will make installation take considerably longer.
====

////
==== Custom Site Generator Pipeline

The `generate` subcommand of `antora` automatically uses the default site generator.
However, Antora is designed with an open architecture to accommodate a myriad of use cases.
That means you can assemble your own site generator pipeline, perhaps to add, substitute, and/or remove components used in the pipeline of the default site generator.
It will be possible in the near future to configure the CLI to use your custom site generator pipeline in place of the default one.
////

Now that the Antora CLI and default site generator are installed, you are ready to set up a playbook and generate a documentation site.

=== Run Antora to Generate a Site

To generate a site with Antora, you need a playbook file that points to at least one content source repository and a UI bundle.
Since the Antora repository is set up as an Antora documentation project, we can use that for now as your content source.
Antora also provides a default UI for you to use out of the box.

==== Create a Playbook File

First, create a new directory for your site and switch to it.
Next, add a playbook file named [.path]_site.yml_ and populate it with the following contents:

.site.yml
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Antora Docs
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora.git
    branches: master
    start_path: docs
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
----

Notice we're looking for a documentation component under the [.path]_docs/_ subdirectory of the master branch of the Antora git repository.
We're also using Antora's default UI as the UI for the site.
Antora will take care of assembling all this input together to produce a documentation site.

The UI bundle can be loaded from a URI or a local filesystem path.
If you want to use your own UI bundle, follow the instructions in the README for the https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/blob/master/README.adoc[Default UI].

==== Run Antora

To generate the site, simply point the `antora` command at your playbook file.

In your terminal, type:

 $ antora site.yml

Antora will clone the content repository, convert the AsciiDoc pages to embeddable HTML, wrap the HTML in a page template from the UI, then assemble the pages together along with the assets into the destination folder, which defaults to [.path]_build/site_.

To view your site, navigate to any HTML page inside the destination folder in your browser.
Using this example, look for the entry point file [.path]_build/site/index.html_.
That file will redirect you to the start page.

==== Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong during generation, you'll see an error message in the terminal.

....
error: a message that summarizes what went wrong
....

If this message does not provide enough information to fix the problem, you can ask Antora for more context.
To tell Antora to reveal the calls leading up to the error (i.e., the stacktrace), run the `antora` command again, this time with the `--stacktrace` option:

 $ antora --stacktrace site.yml

Share this stacktrace when <<Getting Help,asking for help>>.

==== Changing Content

Antora also supports local content, which is essential for authoring.
If you want to make modifications to the documentation, you'll first need to clone the content repository (which in this example just happens to be the Antora repository):

 $ git clone https://gitlab.com/antora/antora.git workspace/antora

Next, update the content source entry in the playbook to point to the local checkout instead of the remote URL:

[source,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: ./workspace/antora
    branches: master
    start_path: docs
----

Now, any changes you make to the content under the [.path]_workspace/antora/docs/_ folder will be visible the next time you generate the site.

==== Running a Local Server (Optional)

A site generated by Antora is designed to be viewable with or without a web server.
However, you may need to view your site through a web server to test certain features, such as indexified URLs or caching.
You can use the serve package for this purpose.

Install the serve package globally using npm:

 $ npm i -g serve

That puts a command by the same name on your PATH.
Now launch the web server by pointing it at the location of the generated site:

 $ serve build/site

Paste the provided URL into the location bar of your browser and you'll be viewing your site through a local web server.

== Release Policy

The Antora Core components includes a default site generator package, the packages the default site generator delegates to, and a CLI package.
These packages are released together and follow the https://semver.org[semantic versioning] rules.
Each Antora platform release is versioned *major.minor.patch*.

Major::
Major releases occur when new functionality breaks backwards compatibility.
Releases within the same major version number will maintain API compatibility.

Minor::
Minor releases add new features, improvements and fixes and maintain backwards compatibility.

Patch::
Patch releases fix bugs and maintain backwards compatibility.
Only the latest minor release for a major release will receive patches.

Pre-release::
Major and minor releases may require numerous pre-release versions (major.minor.patch-alpha.n | -beta.n | -rc.n).
Pre-release versions will be tagged as _next_ so that the npm client doesn't prefer a pre-release over a stable version.
Once a release candidate (rc) has been thoroughly tested, the stable release will be published.

=== Roadmap

The <<roadmap.adoc#,roadmap>> provides the current development direction and schedule for Antora.

Patch releases happen as needed depending on the urgency of the fix.
Minor releases typically occur when one or more new features or improvements have been reviewed, tested and approved.
Major releases require architecture, implementation, and QA iterations that are open to community discussion and review.

=== Support

Major versions of the Antora Core components are maintained for at least 1 year after the {uri-docs}/antora/1.0/project/version-and-lifecycle-policies[initial public stable release].
Only the latest minor release for a major release will receive maintenance releases.
