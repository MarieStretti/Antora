== Purpose

This document serves two purposes.
One, it provides an in-depth outline of Antora's of the categories, sub-categories, pages, and even in some cases a pages sections that we believe will be included in the documentation.
Two, it will provide a rough projection of which pages we believe should be written by quarter.
This projection is subject to change so that it aligns with the development roadmap.
