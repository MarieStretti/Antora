= Command Line Interface (CLI) Reference
:table-caption!:

Antora provides a command line interface (CLI) so you can interact with Antora using your terminal.
When installed, the CLI adds the `antora` command to your terminal's PATH.
This page covers the commands and options the `antora` command accepts and shows several examples.

== Terminal conventions

If you're new to using a terminal, these are the conventions we use when showing terminal examples.

Prompt (`$`)::
The terminal's command prompt is indicated by a dollar sign (`$`).
Don't include the prompt when you type commands.
Only type what immediately follows it.

Working Directory::
Every command is run from a directory, known as the working directory.
You may be asked to change the working directory of your terminal before running a command.
You can change your working directory using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd directory`).

Command Output::
If Antora returns information after a command is executed, the output is displayed in the terminal underneath the command.
The command prompt (`$`) is not displayed in the command output.

== Command structure

The `antora` command accepts user inputs in the form of options, positional arguments, and environment variables.

 $ antora <command> [option] <arguments>

. All functions start with a base call to Antora (`antora`).
. The command tells Antora what operation to perform.
. Additional options can be specified after a command.
Options are prefixed with two hyphens (`--`).
. Positional arguments, such as the name of the playbook file, are specified last.
. Environment variables are read from the terminal's state.

== Get help with the CLI

When you're using the Antora CLI and need help, type `-h` or `--help` after the command.

.Display help for the antora command
 $ antora --help

.Display help for the generate command
 $ antora generate -h

[#cli-run-ex]
== Run the generate command

You can run the generate command implicitly or explicitly.

.Example 1: Run the generate command (implicit)
 $ antora antora-playbook.yml

In Example 1, Antora generates a documentation site using the playbook [.path]_antora-playbook.yml_.

.Example 2: Run the generate command (explicit)
 $ antora generate test-antora-playbook

In Example 2, Antora generates a documentation site using the auto-detected playbook [.path]_test-antora-playbook.yml_.
When the playbook argument doesn't have a file extension, Antora will look for a YAML, JSON, or TOML file matching the playbook name (in that order).

.Example 3: Run the generate command with --to-dir option (implicit)
 $ antora --to-dir prod antora-playbook.toml

In Example 3, Antora generates a documentation site using the playbook [.path]_antora-playbook.toml_.
A directory named [.path]_prod_ will be created (relative to the current working directory) and the site files written to it.

.Example 4: Run the generate command with --to-dir and --title options (explicit)
 $ antora --to-dir site --title "My Awesome Docs" beta-playbook.json

In Example 4, Antora generates a documentation site using the playbook [.path]_beta-playbook.json_.
The site title will be _My Awesome Docs_.
A directory named [.path]_site_ will be created (relative to the current working directory) and the site files written to it.

.Example 5: Have the generate command download updates
 $ antora --fetch antora-playbook.yml

After running the generate command the first time, subsequent runs will use cached copies of remote resources by default (effectively running offline).
Example 5 shows how to run the generate command so it will download (fetch) updates to remote content sources and download a remote UI bundle again.
