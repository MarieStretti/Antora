On this page, you'll find the list of Antora components that can be assembled into a custom site generator pipeline.
Antora has a modular architecture so that components can be easily removed and replaced.
Due to its API, you can also integrate Asciidoctor extensions.

[#core]
== Core components

Core components are assembled into a pipeline by the Site Generator Default component.
The Core components are versioned together.

At this time, only Core components with the same version are designed to work together.
For example, if you want to use the Content Classifier and Page Composer in a custom site generator, make sure each component has the same version.

If you use the CLI (`@antora/cli`) with the default site generator (`@antora/site-generator-default`), then you just have to keep the versions of the CLI and the default site generator in sync.
If you make a custom site generator, you are responsible for keeping each individual component you use in sync.

== Extended components

Extended components provide key functionality for special use cases.
An example of an Extended component is a site publisher provider for an Amazon S3 bucket.
Once ready for xref:ROOT:project/release-schedule.adoc[general availability], Extended components are released and versioned individually.
