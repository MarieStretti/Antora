= Create a Standard Page

A standard page is an AsciiDoc file in the [.path]_pages_ directory of a module.
Standard pages have a header, which includes the page title, and a body, which includes the majority of the page's displayed content.

. Start a new file in a plain text editor such as Atom, Brackets, or gedit.

. On the first line of file, enter a page title.
+
A page title is specified by one equals sign (`=`), followed by one blank space, and then the text of the title.
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
= The title of my new page
----

. On the second line and subsequent contiguous lines, add document metadata and attributes.
*The page title is the only required header element.*

. Separate the header block from the body block by at least one blank line.

. Write your content.
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
= The title of my new page
:attribute-a: value-a

Welcome to the preamble of my new page!

== This is a section title

This is a paragraph.
----

. Save the file.
.. Save the file with the extension `.adoc` in a module's [.path]_pages_ directory.

.. The name you use when saving the file will be used to compute the page's URL.
+
my-new-page.adoc => my-new-page.html

You've now created a standard page.
When you run Antora, it will be converted to an HTML page and published to your site automatically.
If you want a site visitor to locate this page via a component navigation menu, you'll need to add a link to the page (`xref`) to a xref:navigation:index.adoc[navigation file].

The page created in this example is simple.
Using AsciiDoc, a page's header can encompass a wide range of capabilities and its body can handle complex content.

== Page header and body structure

A standard page has two general parts, a header and a body.

The xref:asciidoc:page-header.adoc[page header] is a set of contiguous lines that start on the first line of the file.
The header encapsulates the following elements:

* xref:asciidoc:page-header.adoc#page-title[page title] (required)
* xref:asciidoc:page-header.adoc#page-meta[metadata], such as author information, a page description, and user-defined `page` attributes
* environment settings
* xref:asciidoc:page-header.adoc#page-attrs[built-in AsciiDoc attributes], such as section numbering
* user-defined attributes

A single blank line signals the end of the page header.
The next line with content is the start of the page body.
The page body includes the:

* preamble
* section headings
* section content such as paragraphs, xref:asciidoc:lists.adoc[lists], source code blocks, images, included partials, and much more

//To explore the full capabilities of each AsciiDoc element, check out the documentation under the AsciiDoc collection in the menu on the left.
