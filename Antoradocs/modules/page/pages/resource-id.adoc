= Resource Identifier

No matter which component or module it is stored in, you can include any partial or example in any page, just like you can "`call`" any page using its page ID.

To insert a partial or example from another module or component into a page, you use it's resource ID.
A resource ID is very similar to a page ID except it specifies a family coordinate.

== How is a resource ID structured?

The resource ID is identical to a xref:page-id.adoc#structure[page ID], except it specifies one additional coordinate, the Family.

Family::
The purpose of a resource file.
Files are assigned a family designation based on whether they're stored in _partials_ or _examples_.

The family coordinate is appended with a dollar sign (`$`) and specified after the module coordinate but before the page coordinate.

 version@component:module:family$relative/path-to/resource.ext

The family coordinate accepts the value `partial` or `example`.

== How is a resource referenced with its ID?

A resource ID is used in an AsciiDoc include directive.
Here's how the include directive is structured when inserting a specific version of a partial resource from the ROOT module of a component named cli.

 include::2.2@cli::partial$commands.adoc[]

Or, if you included a tagged region of an example into a page in the same module.

 include::example$config.json[tag=parse]
