= Site-Scoped Attributes

Built-in AsciiDoc attributes, user-defined AsciiDoc attributes, and `page-` attributes can be declared in a site's playbook file.
These attributes are applied to all of a site's pages according to the attribute precedence rules.
Attributes declared in the playbook are referred to as [.term]*site-scoped attributes*.

== Set and unset attributes in the playbook

Each site-scoped attribute is entered on its own line under the playbook's `asciidoc` and `attributes` category keys.

<3> Site-scoped attributes are nested under the `attributes` key.
Enter the name of the attribute, followed by a colon (`:`).
Press kbd:[space] once after the colon, then enter the value of the attribute.
<4> The tilde symbol (`~`) hard unsets this attribute.
See the <<assign-precedence,next section>> to learn more about hard and soft unsetting rules.
<5> To assign the default value, or in the case of a boolean attribute, the _empty string_ value to a built-in AsciiDoc attribute, type two consecutive single quotation marks (`''`) in the value field.
<6> To declare a user-defined `page-` attribute, type `page-` and the name of your attribute, followed by a colon (`:`).
Press kbd:[space] once after the colon, then enter the value of the attribute.
<7> This user-defined attribute is hard set.
See the <<assign-precedence,next section>> to learn more about hard and soft setting rules.

Site-scoped attributes are applied and available to every page in your site.
The values of user-defined attributes, such as `page-team` and `db` can be displayed in a page using the attribute reference syntax (e.g., `+{db}+`).

[#assign-precedence]
== Assign precedence to site-scoped attributes

You can control whether a site-scoped attribute can be overridden from a component descriptor file or a page.
Site-scoped attributes that are hard set and hard unset can't be changed by a component descriptor file or a page.
However, soft set and unset site-scoped attributes can be overridden from the component descriptor or page.

The following example shows how site-scoped attributes are assigned hard and soft precedence.

.Assigning hard and soft precedence to attributes in the playbook
[source,yaml]

asciidoc:
  attributes:
    example-caption: Scenario # <1>
    page-team: Coco B@ # <2>
    figure-caption: ~ # <3>
    table-caption: false # <4>
----
<1> To hard set an attribute, simply enter its value.
Hard set site-scoped attributes can't be reassigned or unset by a component descriptor or page.
<2> To soft set an attribute, attach the `@` modifier to the end of its value.
A component descriptor or page can override soft set site-scoped attributes.
<3> To hard unset an attribute, assign it the tilde symbol (`~`).
Hard unset site-scoped attributes can't be set by a component descriptor or page.
<4> To soft unset an attribute, assign the value `false`.
A component descriptor or page can override soft unset site-scoped attributes.

include::partial$playbook-vs-descriptor.adoc[]

Antora takes the precedence assigned to attributes in the site's playbook into account first.
*Only soft set and soft unset site-scoped attributes can be overridden*.

.*Site-scoped attribute precedence rules*
. Hard setting a site-scoped attribute to a string value with no trailing `@` modifier (e.g., `value`) prevents a component descriptor or page from changing (setting or unsetting) the attribute.
. Soft setting a site-scoped attribute to a string value with a trailing `@` modifier (e.g., `value@`) allows a component descriptor or page to change (set or unset) the attribute.
. Hard unsetting a site-scoped attribute using the tilde symbol (`~`) prevents  component descriptor or page from setting the attribute.
. Soft unsetting a site-scoped attribute using the `false` value allows a component descriptor or page to set the attribute.
