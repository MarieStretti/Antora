* [x] How to mark up an example with AsciiDoc.

== Example syntax

An example paragraph or delimited block is useful for visually delineating content that illustrates a concept or showing the result of an operation.

An example can contain any type of content and AsciiDoc syntax.
Normal substitutions are applied to example content.

=== Example paragraph

If the example content is contiguous, i.e., not interrupted by blank lines, the block name `example` can be placed directly on top of the text in an attribute list (`[]`).

.Example paragraph syntax
----
.Optional title
[example]
This is an example paragraph.
----

.Optional title
[example]
This is an example paragraph.

[#delimited]
=== Delimited example block

If the example content includes elements separated by blank lines, place the content between delimiter lines consisting of four equals signs (`pass:[====]`).

You don't need to set the block name when you use a delimited block.
