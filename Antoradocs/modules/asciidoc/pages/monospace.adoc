On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to apply monospace formatting to inline text in AsciiDoc.
* [x] Where to modify your site's inline monospace text styling.

Technical content often requires text to be styled in a way that indicates it is a command or source code.
Such text is usually emphasized using a fixed-width, i.e., monospace, font.

== Inline monospace syntax

A word or phrase is marked as monospace when it is enclosed in a single set of backticks (`++`word`++`) (constrained formatting).
Bounded characters are marked as monospace when they're enclosed in a set of double backticks (`++char``act``ers++`) (unconstrained formatting).

Bounded characters are characters that are:

* directly preceded by a non-whitespace character, or
* directly followed by a non-whitespace character.

.Monospace inline formatting
[source,asciidoc]
----
A monospace `word`, and a monospace `phrase of text`.

Monospace c``hara``cter``s`` within a word.
----

You don't need to use double backticks when an entire word or phrase marked as monospace is directly followed by a common punctuation mark, such as `;`, `"`, and `!`.

.Results
====
A monospace `word`, and a monospace `phrase of text`.

Monospace c``hara``cter``s`` within a word.
====

== Mixing monospace with other formatting

You can add multiple emphasis styles to monospace text as long as the syntax is placed in the correct order.

.Order of inline formatting syntax
[source,asciidoc]
----
`*_monospace bold italic phrase_*` & ``**__char__**``acter``**__s__**``
----

Monospace syntax is always the outermost formatting set.
xref:bold.adoc[Bold syntax] (`+*+`) must be outside the italic formatting set.
xref:italic.adoc[Italic syntax] (`+_+`) is always the innermost formatting set.

.Result
====
`*_monospace bold italic phrase_*` & ``**__char__**``acter``**__s__**``
====

== Site styles

How inline monospace text appears on your site depends on the fonts loaded by your UI and any CSS styles applied to the `<code>` HTML tag.
You can learn more about customizing xref:antora-ui-default::inline-text-styles.adoc#monospace[how monospace text appears in your site] in the UI documentation.
