On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to italicize text in AsciiDoc.
* [x] Where to modify your site's italic text styling.

Text is often italicized in order to stress a word or phrase, quote a speaker, or introduce a term.
Italic type slants slightly to the right, and depending on the font, may have cursive swashes and flourishes.

== Italic syntax

A word or phrase is marked as italic when it is enclosed in a single set of underscores (`+_word_+`) (constrained formatting).
Bounded characters are marked as italic when they're enclosed in a set of double underscores (`+char__act__ers+`) (unconstrained formatting).

Bounded characters are characters that are:

* directly preceded by a non-whitespace character, or
* directly followed by a non-whitespace character.

.Italic inline formatting
[source,asciidoc]
----
An italic _word_, and an italic _phrase of text_.

Italic c__hara__cter__s__ within a word.
----

You don't need to use double underscores when an entire word or phrase marked as italic is directly followed by a common punctuation mark, such as `;`, `"`, and `!`.

.Results
====
An italic _word_, and an italic _phrase of text_.

Italic c__hara__cter__s__ within a word.

== Mixing italic with other formatting

You can add multiple emphasis styles to italic text as long as the syntax is placed in the correct order.

.Order of inline formatting syntax
[source,asciidoc]
----
`*_monospace bold italic phrase_*` & ``**__char__**``acter``**__s__**``
----

xref:monospace.adoc[Monospace syntax] (`++`++`) must be the outermost formatting set.
xref:bold.adoc[Bold syntax] (`+*+`) must be outside the italics formatting set.
Italic syntax is always the innermost formatting set.

.Result
====
`*_monospace bold italic phrase_*` & ``**__char__**``acter``**__s__**``
====

== Site styles

How italic text appears on your site depends on the fonts loaded by your UI and any CSS styles applied to the `<em>` HTML tag.
You can learn more about customizing xref:antora-ui-default::inline-text-styles.adoc#italics[how italic text appears in your site] in the UI documentation.
