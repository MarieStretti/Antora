= Lists

With AsciiDoc you can create several types of lists that contain a variety content, such as images, example blocks, and notices.
You can even mix the different list item types into one list.

But first, some terminology.

A *list* is an AsciiDoc block element that contains list items.

A *list item* is content, which can include multiple paragraphs or blocks, that may be preceded by a marker, number, letter, or symbol depending on the list type and options assigned to list.

== List types

xref:checklists.adoc[Checklist]::
Also known as a task or punch list, these lists contain items marked by either an empty ballot box (&#9744;) or a checked box (&#9745;).
You can even create clickable task lists with AsciiDoc.

xref:description-lists.adoc[Description list]::
A list of terms and their corresponding descriptions and definitions.

xref:ordered-and-unordered-lists.adoc#ordered[Ordered list]::
A list of enumerated items preceded by a number or letter in a sequence.

xref:ordered-and-unordered-lists.adoc#unordered[Unordered list]::
A list of items typically preceded by a bullet (&#8226;), and therefore also known as bullet points or bulleted lists.
xref:navigation:list-structures.adoc[Component navigation menus] are constructed from unordered AsciiDoc lists.
