On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] When you should use a URL versus a cross reference.
* [x] How to create links with and without link text.
* [x] How to escape a URL.
* [x] How to handle complex URLs.

== URL or cross reference?

Use AsciiDoc's URL syntax when you need to create a link to an external URL.
External URLs are links to webpages that aren't built as part of your documentation site by your Antora pipeline.

When you want to link to a page that is part of your documentation site, use the xref:page-to-page-xref.adoc[page cross reference] instead.

[#url-syntax]
== URL syntax

To create a link to an external URL, all you need to do is add the URL prefixed with its scheme.

Links that begin with official schemes, such as `https`, `ftp`, `mailto`, etc., are automatically turned into hyperlinks when they're processed.

To attach a URL to text, enclose the text in square brackets (`[]`) at the end of the URL.

== Escape a URL

When you want to display a URL but you don't want it to be active, you can escape it by prepending it with a backslash (`\`).

== Troubleshooting URLs

A URL may not display correctly when it contains characters such as underscores (`{underscore}`) or carets (`{caret}`) because these characters get interpreted as text formatting markup.

There are two ways to solve this situation.

[no-bullet]
* Option 1: Create a page attribute for the URL.
* Option 2: Use the inline pass macro with `macros` enabled.

=== Create a page attribute

Let's make an attribute for a complex URL.
Creating an attribute for a URL is also a good strategy when the URL is long; it keeps the source text clean for writers and editors.

{url-peak}[This URL] was complicated, but a page attribute came to our rescue! // <2>
----
<1> Create an attribute, with the name of your choice, in the header of your source file.
Assign the URL to it.
<2> When you want to create a link to that URL in your text, use the attribute (i.e., reference that attribute), as you would have used the URL.

.Result
====
{url-peak}[This URL^] was complicated, but a page attribute came to our rescue!
====

=== Use the pass macro

If you want to display a complex URL and ensure it doesn't get caught up in any text formatting, put it inside a pass macro and enable the macros substitution, which is what substitutes links.

Here's how a pass macro with the macros substitution enabled is constructed:

[source,asciidoc]

pass:macros[URL goes between these brackets]

Here's a pass macro in action:
