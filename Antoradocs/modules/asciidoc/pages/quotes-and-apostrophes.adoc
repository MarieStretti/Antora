* [x] How to use single and double curved quotation marks.
* [x] How to use curved apostrophes.

== Curved quotation mark syntax

Single and double quotation marks are *not* rendered as curved quotation marks by default.
When entered using the kbd:['] and kbd:["] keys, Asciidoctor outputs straight
quotation marks.

If you want to output curved quotation marks, you need to add a set of backticks (`{backtick}`) contained within a set of single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

"`This should be enclosed in curved double quotes when published.`"

.Result
====
'`This should be enclosed in curved single quotes when published.`'

"`This should be enclosed in curved double quotes when published.`"
====

== Curved apostrophe syntax

When entered with the kbd:['] key, an apostrophe that is directly preceded and followed by a character, such as in contractions and possessive singular forms, is automatically output as a curved apostrophe.

However, an apostrophe directly followed by white space, such as the possessive plural form, is not curved by default.

To output an apostrophe as curved when it is not bound by two characters, mark it as you would a single curved quote.

=== Escape a curved apostrophe

If you don't want an apostrophe that is bound by two characters to be curved, escape it by preceding it with a backslash (`{backslash}`).
