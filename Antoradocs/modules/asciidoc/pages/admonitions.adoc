On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to mark up an admonition with AsciiDoc.
* [x] How to create an admonition with complex content.

== Admonition styles

An admonition, also known as a notice, helps draw attention to content with a special label or icon.

Asciidoctor comes with five built-in admonition labels.

* NOTE
* TIP
* IMPORTANT
* CAUTION
* WARNING

== Basic admonition

If the admonition content is not interrupted by blank lines, start the first line  with a style label.
The label must be all uppercase and followed by a colon (`:`) and a single blank space.

CAUTION: Don't stick forks in electric sockets.

TIP: After someone sticks a fork in a socket, you'll need to reset the circuit in the breaker box in the dark and scary basement.

WARNING: Never go into the basement.

IMPORTANT: A monster lives in the basement.

NOTE: If you go into the basement, see if you can find Kenny's parka.

== Complex admonition

If the admonition content includes elements separated by blank lines, place the content in a xref:examples.adoc#delimited[delimited example block] (`pass:[====]`).
This behavior is referred to as masquerading.
Place the appropriate label, in all uppercase, on the block in an attribute list (`[]`).
