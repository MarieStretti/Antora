On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to configure the output directory.
* [x] How to configure multiple destinations and providers.
* [x] How to specify a custom provider.

[#output-dir]
== Directory

When you only need to output the site to a single directory, you can use the output dir key.
This key is meant to provide a shorthand to the more formal destinations key.

The output `dir` specifies the directory where the generated site will be published.
The key accepts a relative or absolute filesystem path.

A relative path will be expanded to an absolute path.

* If the first path segment is `~`, the path is resolved relative to the user's home directory.
* If the first path segment is `.`, the path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file.
* If the first path segment is `~+`, or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the path is resolved relative to the current working directory.

IMPORTANT: The dir key overrides the path key of the first `fs` provider specified in the destinations key.
This allows the output directory to be overridden from the xref:cli:index.adoc[CLI] using the `--to-dir=<dir>` option.

=== Default output dir

The default output directory is [.path]_build/site_.
If no destinations are specified in the playbook, all site files will be written to this directory.
To disable this default, either specify at least one destination under the destinations key or set the destinations key to an empty array (`[]`).

[#add-dir]
=== Explicit value

In the relative `dir` example, the site will be published to a folder named [.path]_launch_ relative to the playbook file.

.Relative dir value
[source,yaml]
----
output:
  dir: ./launch
----

In the absolute `dir` example, the site will be published to [.path]_home/dev/docs-site/beta_ regardless of where the playbook is located.

.Absolute dir value
[source,yaml]
----
output:
  dir: /home/user/docs-site/beta
----

[#output-destinations]
== Destinations

When you need to publish to multiple destinations, you'll use the destinations key.
The destinations key accepts a list of destination specifications.
Each destination specification must include the provider key, which indicates which provider should be used to publish the site and which type of publication it will be.

[#output-providers]
=== Providers

Antora offers two built-in providers.

Filesystem (`fs`)::
Publishes the output files to a directory.
Archive (`archive`)::
Publishes the output files to a {url-zip-file-format}[ZIP] archive file.

You can also create custom providers for SSH, S3, etc.

[#fs-provider]
==== Filesystem provider

The `fs` provider publishes the site to a directory.
It's the formal equivalent to specifying the dir key on output.

.Filesystem provider
[source,yaml]
----
output:
  destinations:
  - provider: fs
----

In this example, the site is published to [.path]_build/site_.

[#archive-provider]
==== Archive provider

The `archive` provider publishes a site to a {url-zip-file-format}[ZIP] file.

.Archive provider
[source,yaml]
----
output:
  destinations:
  - provider: archive
----

In this example, the site is generated as a ZIP file and published to [.path]_build/site.zip_.

[#output-path]
=== Path

The path key on a destination allows you to specify an output location per provider.
It accepts a relative or absolute filesystem path.
The provider will create any interim directories as needed.

A relative path will be expanded to an absolute path.

* If the first path segment is `~`, the path is resolved relative to the user's home directory.
* If the first path segment is `.`, the path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file.
* If the first path segment is `~+`, or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the path is resolved relative to the current working directory.

IMPORTANT: If you set the dir key in a playbook or via the CLI, its value will override the `path` value of the first `fs` provider specified in the destinations key.

==== Default paths

The default `fs` path is [.path]_build/site_.

The default `archive` path is [.path]_build/site.zip_.

[#archive-path]
==== Explicit path

In the relative path example, we're running Antora on a playbook located in a directory named [.path]_docs-site_.

.Relative archive provider path
[source,yaml]
----
output:
  destinations:
  - provider: archive
    path: ./blue.zip
----

Once generation is complete, the site will be published to [.path]_docs-site/blue.zip_.

In the absolute path example, we can run Antora on a playbook located anywhere on our computer.

.Absolute archive provider path
[source,yaml]
----
output:
  destinations:
  - provider: archive
    path: /home/user/projects/launch/blue.zip
----

Once generation is complete, the site will be published to [.path]_/home/user/projects/launch/blue.zip_.

////
When a value is assigned to the output directory key, the archive path is appended to the `dir` path.

.Dir and archive provider path
[source,yaml]
----
output:
 dir: ./launch/sites
 destinations:
 - provider: archive
   path: ./blue.zip
----

In this example, the archived site will be located at [.path]_launch/sites/blue.zip_.
////

=== Multiple destinations

In this example, we're running Antora on a playbook file in the directory named [.path]_tmp_ and publishing the site to two locations, one relative and one absolute.

.Relative fs path and absolute archive path
[source,yaml]
----
output:
  destinations:
  - provider: fs
    path: ./releases/red
    clean: true
  - provider: archive
    path: /home/user/projects/docs-site/blue.zip
----

The site published using the `fs` provider to the directory [.path]_tmp/releases/red_.
This directory will be removed prior to publishing since we've turned the clean key on.
The site is also published as an archive to [.path]_/home/user/projects/docs-site/blue.zip_ by the `archive` provider.

=== Custom Provider

If the provider key does not contain a recognized built-in provider, Antora will attempt to require it as a Node module.
This allows you to supply a custom provider.

If the value begins with a dot (`.`), Antora will require the path relative to the playbook file.
Otherwise, Antora will require the value as a Node module installed in the playbook project.

The custom provider is a JavaScript function that matches the following signature:

[source,js]
async function publish (destConfig, files, playbook)

The destConfig argument is an object containing key/value pairs that correspond to the properties of the destination specification.
The files argument is a ReadableStream of virtual files.
The playbook argument is the object containing key/value pairs from the playbook as a whole.

WARNING: The custom provider is an alpha API and subject to change.
