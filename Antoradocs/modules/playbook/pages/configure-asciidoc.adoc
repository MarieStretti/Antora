[#attrs]
== AsciiDoc attributes

Built-in AsciiDoc attributes, user-defined AsciiDoc attributes, and `page-` attributes can be declared in a site's playbook file and are referred to as [.term]*site-scoped attributes*.
These attributes are nested under the `asciidoc` and `attributes` category keys in the playbook.

.Declaring site-scoped AsciiDoc attributes
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    hide-uri-scheme: ''
    page-team: Coco B
    table-caption: ~
----

Site-scoped attributes are applied and available to all of a site's pages according to the xref:page:site-scoped-attributes.adoc#assign-precedence[attribute precedence rules].
See xref:page:site-scoped-attributes.adoc[Site-scoped attributes] to learn how to set, assign, and unset attributes in the playbook in more detail.
Also, attributes can be xref:page:component-scoped-attributes.adoc[declared by component version] and may override site-scoped attributes depending on the the attribute's assigned precedence.

[#extensions]
== Asciidoctor extensions

The `asciidoc` category can also used for registering Asciidoctor extensions.
First, you need to install the extension code, which you can either do by installing it globally, declaring it as a dependency of the project, or adding the extension script to the playbook project.
Then, you can register the extension using the `extensions` key.
The `extensions` key accepts a list of node module names (i.e., npm package names) and/or paths.

[#global-extensions]
=== Global Asciidoctor extensions

Global extensions are registered once, before any pages are converted.
These extensions are shared by all documents Antora converts using Asciidoctor (including navigation files).
A global extension is a node module or script that exports a function when required.
Antora passes this function directly to the `register` method of Asciidoctor's static extension registry.

To register a global extension, all you need to do is reference its name (if it's a node module on the require path) or path (if it's a local script) in the `extensions` key.

.Register a global extension provided by a node module
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - asciidoctor-emoji-macro
----

In this case, `asciidoctor-emoji-macro` is the name of an installed node module and is thus available on the require path (either in the [.path]__node_modules__ directory in the playbook project or in the global [.path]__node_modules__ directory).

.Register a global extension from a local script
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - ./lib/shout-block
----

In this case, the extension is a script located at the path [.path]_lib/shout-block.js_ relative to the playbook file.

Here's an example that shows how to register multiple global extensions:

.Register multiple global extensions
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - asciidoctor-emoji-macro
  - ./lib/shout-block
----

[#scoped-extensions]
=== Scoped Asciidoctor extensions

Rather than requiring an extension globally, you may want to register an extension per instance of the AsciiDoc processor.
The benefit of this approach is that it allows the extension to hook into the Antora lifecycle.
The other difference is that scoped extensions are only registered and used for pages, not for navigation files.

In order to register a scoped extension, the extension must support this mode of usage.
Specifically, the extension must export a `register` function that accepts an extension registry on which it self registers.
The function is called with a scoped (per-processor) extension registry and a context object.
The context object includes the current file, the content catalog, and the AsciiDoc configuration object from the playbook.

Here's an example of a `register` function for a scoped extension:

.Scoped Asciidoctor extension register function
[source,js]
----
module.exports.register = function (registry, context) {
  registry.block('shout', createShoutBlock(context))
}
----

A scoped extension is registered in the playbook in exactly the same way as a global extension.

.Register a scoped extension from the require path
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - asciidoctor-plantuml
----

.Register a scoped extension from a local script
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - ./lib/equation-macro
----

The main difference is that if the extension exports the `register` function, it gets scoped to the processor instance instead of being registered globally.

//Perhaps we should require #register at the end of the extension; hmmm

=== Preloading modules

Instead of registering extensions using the playbook, you can preload extensions using the `-r` (or `--require`) CLI option.
The value of this option may be either a path to a file (relative to the current directory), or a node module name.
The `-r` option may be specified multiple times.

This option gives site authors the ability to load additional code into the runtime before Antora begins executing.
The option follows the module resolution rules of the `require()` function in Node.
A common use case for this option is to register Asciidoctor extensions globally.

If the node module or script is an Asciidoctor extension, it must self-register with Asciidoctor's static extension registry when required in order for the extension to be used.
(Antora merely requires the script.
It does not invoke its exported function).

Here's an example showing how to use the Antora CLI to preload multiple Asciidoctor extensions:

 $ antora -r ./lib/shout-block -r asciidoctor-emoji-macro anotra-playbook.yml

The `-r` option can also be used for other purposes, such as to alter global state or override Antora components.

For more information about the CLI, see the xref:cli:index.adoc[CLI commands and options] page.
