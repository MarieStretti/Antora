On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to install Chocolatey, the Windows package manager.
* [x] How to install Node.

If you've never installed Antora before, you'll need to complete the steps on this page before you can install Antora and use it to generate a documentation site.

== Node

We recommend using the latest long term support (LTS) release of Node.
While you can use other versions of Node, Antora is only tested against {url-node-releases}[active LTS releases^].

To see if you have Node installed, and which version, open PowerShell and type:

 $ node --version

You should see a version string, such as:

[subs=attributes+]
....
v{version-node}
....

If *the command fails with an error*, you don't have Node installed.
The best way to install Node on Windows is to use Chocolatey.
If you don't have Chocolatey on your machine, go to <<install-choco,install Chocolatey>> to get it set up.
Otherwise, skip directly to <<install-nvm,install nvm and Node>>.

If *the command returns a version that isn't an active LTS version*, upgrade to the latest Node LTS version <<upgrade-node,using nvm>>.

If *the command returns an active Node LTS version*, you're all set to xref:install-antora.adoc[install Antora].

[#install-choco]
== Install Chocolatey

The best way to install the Node Version Manager (nvm) and Node is with {url-choco}[Chocolatey^], the package manager for Windows.

. Open a PowerShell terminal and run it as an Administrator by right clicking on the PowerShell icon and selecting menu:Run as Administrator[].

. Type the following command in the terminal:

 $ Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

You're now ready to install nvm and Node.

[#install-nvm]
== Install nvm and Node

. Open a PowerShell terminal, right click on the PowerShell icon, and select menu:Run as Administrator[].
+
TIP: If you just installed Chocolatey using the instructions in the proceeding section, use the same terminal (running as Administrator) that you already have open.

. To install the {url-nvm-windows}[Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows^], enter the following command in the terminal:

 $ choco install -y nvm

. Close the terminal.

. Open an new, regular PowerShell terminal, and install Node using nvm.
+
--
[subs=attributes+]
 $ nvm install {version-node}

IMPORTANT: When using nvm for Windows, you must enter an exact version of Node (e.g., `{version-node}`) until {url-nvm-windows}/issues/214[nvm-windows#214^] is resolved.
--

Now that Node is installed, you're ready to xref:install-antora.adoc[install Antora].

.nvm and CI environments
****
You can install the LTS release of Node directly, without installing nvm, by entering the following command in the Administrator PowerShell:

 $ choco install -y nodejs-lts

However, many CI environments use nvm to install the Node version used for the build job.
By using nvm, you closely align your setup with the environment used to generate and publish your production site.
****

[#upgrade-node]
== Upgrade Node using nvm

If you have nvm installed but your Node version is not an LTS release, type the following command in your terminal:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ nvm install {version-node}

IMPORTANT: When using nvm for Windows, you must enter the full version of Node (i.e., `nvm install {version-node}`).

Once you've installed Node, you're ready to xref:install-antora.adoc[install Antora].
