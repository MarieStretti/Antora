Antora runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Thanks to this broad platform support, Antora is also used on many cloud platforms and continuous integration and delivery servers.

== Platforms

Our general policy is to align Antora's support of a platform version with the upstream project's lifecycle schedule for that version.
When a platform version reaches its end of life (EOL), Antora no longer supports it.

// When we have specific notes about a platform (tweaks and/or links to bugs) add a 3rd column to this table labeled "Good to Know"

.About the Antora Test Suite
****
At last count, Antora had {test-count} tests that cover {test-coverage} of the lines.
You could say we're just a teeny-tiny bit obsessed with writing high quality tests and improving test coverage.
****

=== Cloud platforms

Antora should operate as designed on common cloud platforms.
How you provision your cloud instance depends on your workload requirements and remote git repository sizes.
If you're running Antora on a cloud platform, we would love to hear about your experience (open a {url-issues}[new issue^] or join us in the {url-chat-dev}[development channel^]).

== Hardware recommendations

Your hardware requirements will depend primarily on the size of the remote git repositories your Antora pipeline fetches content from when it is generating your site.

The first time Antora runs, it fetches and clones all of the remote git repositories specified in a playbook.
The speed of this operation is dictated by the size of the remote repositories, environment input/output parameters, and network performance.
After the initial run, Antora caches the repositories locally.
On subsequent runs, Antora only reconnects to the remote repositories if the xref:playbook:configure-runtime.adoc#fetch[fetch option] is enabled or the xref:playbook:configure-runtime.adoc#cache[cache folder] is removed.

|RAM
|Memory requirements depend on the size of your Git repositories.
3GB should provide sufficient headroom.

|I/O
|Maximum throughput and minimum latency always make things nicer but aren't required.
