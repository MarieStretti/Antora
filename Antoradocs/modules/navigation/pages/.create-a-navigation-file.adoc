Info about where to store a nav file and any alternatives.

On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to structure a navigation file.
* [x] How to add cross references to a navigation list.
* [x] How to add regular text and links to other websites to a navigation list.

Each module contains a navigation file named [.path]_nav.adoc_.
In Antora, this navigation file is called linked navigation.

== List structure

In an xref:asciidoc:ordered-and-unordered-lists.adoc#unordered[AsciiDoc unordered list], each top-level navigation item is marked by a single (`{asterisk}`).
Each top-level item can have as many nested items as you need up to level five (`+*****+`).
Also, a list can have an optional title, denoted by a period (`.`).

.Single navigation list anatomy
----
.List title (optional)
* First level (top) item
** Second level item
*** Third level item
**** Fourth level item
***** Fifth level item
* First level item
* First level item
----

=== Multiple lists in a single file

A navigation file can contain multiple lists when each of those lists have a title.
Each list must be separate by at least one blank line.

.List title
* First level item
** Second level item
* First level item

== Add links to documentation pages

The most common items in a navigation file are cross references to pages in the module where the navigation file will be stored.

.xrefs to in-module pages
[source,asciidoc]
----
.xref:index.adoc[Product Intro]
* xref:get-started.adoc[Getting Started with Product]
** xref:install/prerequisites.adoc[Install the Prerequisites]
* xref:page-a.adoc[Another Important Topic]
----

However, using the xref:asciidoc:page-to-page-xref.adoc[appropriate xref pattern], you can include references to any document in the site, whether it's stored in the same module or not.

.xrefs to pages in other modules and components
[source,asciidoc]
----
.xref:index.adoc[In-module page]
* xref:other-module:page.adoc[Page in same component, but a different module]
** xref:topic/page.adoc[In-module page in a topic folder]
* xref:component:module:page-a.adoc[Page in another component]
----

== Add unlinked text

A navigation list can contain normal (i.e. unlinked) text.

.Unlinked list items
[source,asciidoc]
----
.The Special Project // <1>
* xref:index.adoc[Project Intro]
** xref:get-started.adoc[Getting Started with Project]
* Orientation // <2>
* xref:page-a.adoc[Project Concepts]
----
<1> An unlinked list block title
<2> An unlinked list item

== Add links to external websites

A navigation list can contain links to external websites.
External links are links to webpages that aren't built as part of your documentation by your site's Antora pipeline.

To create a list item that links to an external URL, just use AsciiDoc's xref:asciidoc:external-urls.adoc[URL syntax].

.External link list items

* xref:get-started.adoc[Getting Started with Project]
** xref:page-a.adoc[Project Concepts]
