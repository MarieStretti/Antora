[#thank-you-2-3-0]
== Thank you!

Most important of all, a huge *thank you!* to all the folks who helped make Antora even better.

We want to call out the following people for making contributions to this release:

//David Jencks ({url-gitlab}/djencks[@djencks^]):: For implementing the [.path]_robots.txt_ generation {url-issues}/219[#219^], for helping to get to the bottom of {url-issues}/497[#497^] and come up with a solution, and for helping to improve the documentation.

[#deprecation]
== Scheduled deprecations for Antora 3.0

The ability to use parent references in the target of the AsciiDoc image macro (e.g., `image::../../../module-b/_images/image-filename.png[]`) will be deprecated in Antora 3.0.
You should begin replacing any such image targets with resource IDs.
