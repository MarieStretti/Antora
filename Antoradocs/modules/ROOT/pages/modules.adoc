== What is a module?

A documentation component is composed of one or more modules.
A [.term]*module* is a discrete bundle of content that is usually related by concept, stage, feature, or workflow.
A module can contain full page text files, reusable text and example snippets, images, and other source materials that are organized into <<family,families>>.
The content associated with a module is stored in a module directory and its files are sorted into family subdirectories.

== Module directory names and structure

A module directory represents a module in a documentation component.
A component's module directories must reside in the xref:component-structure.adoc#modules-dir[_modules_ directory].
<<fig-1>> illustrates a documentation component with three module directories.
You can create as many module directories as you require.

.Directory structure of a documentation component containing two named modules and a ROOT module.
[#fig-1]
image::module-dir-structure.png[alt="Directory structure of a component containing three modules. The ROOT module contains all of the possible family subdirectories.",width="240"]

<<fig-1>> contains two directories that represent named modules, [.path]_a-named-module_ and [.path]_another-named-module_.
You choose the directory name of a named module.
This directory name is then used as the module coordinate in a resource ID, so it can't contain spaces.
If your team often references pages, examples, images, or partials across modules, they'll have to type the target file's module coordinate in a resource ID, so don't make the directory name hard to remember or extremely long.

In addition to being the module coordinate, the directory name of a module, with the exception of the special [.path]_ROOT_ directory, also appears in the site's output path.
See <<named-module-urls>> to learn more.

Inside of a module directory, you can create one or more <<family,family subdirectories>>.
Antora recognizes family subdirectories named [.path]_attachments_, [.path]_examples_, [.path]_images_, [.path]_pages_, and [.path]_partials_.
In <<fig-1>>, the [.path]_a-named-module_ directory contains two family subdirectories while the [.path]_ROOT_ directory just happens to contain all five possible family subdirectories.

Let's examine the role of the ROOT module in more depth.

[#root-dir]
=== ROOT module

The [.term]*ROOT module* typically contains the content that's directly associated with the documentation component itself.

image::root-dir-structure.png[alt="Directory structure of the ROOT module that uses the subdirectories named examples, pages, and partials.",width="190"]

The directory name, [.path]_ROOT_, as well as when the module coordinate, `ROOT`, is used in a resource ID, must be written in uppercase.

We recommend you create a [.path]_ROOT_ module directory in your component because Antora automatically applies component-level URLs to the <<pages-dir,page files>> stored in it.
When the pages in the ROOT module are published, these pages are promoted a level above any other modules`' pages in that component's URL.
This means that, unlike the named modules, the directory name [.path]_ROOT_ isn't displayed in the site's output path.
You can see an example of a ROOT page's URL in <<root-module-urls>>.

Small documentation components may never need more than a ROOT module.
However, as your project grows, you can easily add more modules and gradually redistribute the content without having to restructure the project.
So while the extra structure seems like overkill now, in the long run, you'll be glad you gave your content the space to grow.

Now, let's review the requirements of each of the family subdirectories in more detail.

[#family]
== What is a family?

A [.term]*family* is a collection of files in a module that share the same content type or output role.
These files are stored in the standardized family subdirectories, [.path]_attachments_, [.path]_examples_, [.path]_images_, [.path]_pages_, and [.path]_partials_, within a module.
Antora automatically assigns preset behavior to the files it finds in these subdirectories.
Example, image, page, and partial files can be referenced by any module or component using Antora's resource IDs.
(The ability to reference attachments using a resource ID is coming soon.)

[#attachments-dir]
== Attachments

image::attachments-dir.png[The attachments subdirectory of a module,179]

An attachment is a resource, such as the ZIP archive of a sample project, that a site visitor can download via a link.
Attachment files are saved in the [.path]_attachments_ directory.
A link to an attachment is created using the xref:asciidoc:link-attachment.adoc[AsciiDoc link macro].

=== Binaries and other large files

If your documentation component contains large attachment files, such as sample project binaries, libraries, or PDFs, we don't recommend storing them in a regular git repository.
Instead, host them in a binary repository such as Bintray or S3, or use git LFS (Large File Storage).

[#examples-dir]
== Examples

image::examples-dir.png[The examples subdirectory of a module,176]

The [.path]_examples_ directory contains non-AsciiDoc file types, such as source code or sample data sets.
An example is inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:include-example.adoc[AsciiDoc include directive and the example's resource ID].

[#images-dir]
== Images

image::images-dir.png[The images subdirectory of a module,176]

Photographs, diagrams, screenshots, and other graphics files are saved in the [.path]_images_ directory.
They're inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:insert-image.adoc[block or inline image macros].
AsciiDoc supports PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF (static and animated) image file formats.

[#pages-dir]
== Pages

image::pages-dir.png[The pages subdirectory of a module,174]

AsciiDoc files destined to become xref:page:index.adoc#standard[site pages] are stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of a module.
These files are converted to HTML and automatically published as individual pages in the generated site.

[#root-module-urls]
=== URLs for ROOT module pages

When the AsciiDoc files stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of ROOT are published to a documentation site, they're promoted a level above any other modules`' pages in that component's URL.
To demonstrate this concept, let's compare the URLs of two pages, one from a ROOT module and one from a named module.
The standardized directory structure illustrated in <<fig-2>> contains the documentation for a software product named _Hyper Lemur_.
Notice that there is a file named [.path]_deploy.adoc_ in the [.path]_pages_ directory of ROOT.

.Directory structure of the Hyper Lemur documentation.
[#fig-2]
image::hyperlemur-dir-structure.png[,260]

When Antora generates a site that includes the documentation for Hyper Lemur, the URL for the page created from the [.path]_deploy.adoc_ file would look like this.

//.URL for deploy.adoc page in ROOT module
image::root-page-url.svg[ROOT module page URL,role=grow-x]

The base URL, _\https://my-company.com_, xref:playbook:configure-site.adoc#configure-url[is set in the playbook] Antora uses to generate the site.
The component name segment, _hyperlemur_, is set by the `name` key in the xref:component-descriptor.adoc#name-key[component descriptor].
The version segment, _1.0_, is set by the `version` key in the xref:component-descriptor.adoc#version-key[component descriptor].
The page name segment, _deploy_, is the basename of the AsciiDoc file [.path]_deploy.adoc_.

Notice that the name of the module, _ROOT_, isn't in the URL.
Now, let's see what the URL of a page stored in the named module, _admin_, would look like.

[#named-module-urls]
=== URLs for named module pages

AsciiDoc files stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of named modules are preceded by the name of the module.
The module name is the name of the module directory where that page is stored.
Using the Hyper Lemur documentation shown in <<fig-2>>, let's see what the URL for the [.path]_user-management.adoc_ file stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of the _admin_ module would look like.

//.URL for user-management.adoc page in a-module
image::module-page-url.svg[Named module page URL,role=grow-x]

Notice that the name of the module, _admin_, is in the URL directly after the documentation component's version.

[#partials-dir]
== Partials

image::partials-dir.png[The partials subdirectory of a module,177]

xref:page:index.adoc#partial[Partials] are AsciiDoc files that contain reusable content snippets such as product descriptions and definitions.
They're stored in the [.path]_partials_ directory in a module.
A partial file or a tagged portion of a partial file is inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:include-partial.adoc[AsciiDoc include directive and the partial's resource ID].

[#assets-dir]
.Assets
****
A module can also contain a directory named [.path]_assets_.
This is an alternate location, recognized by Antora, where the [.path]_attachments_ and [.path]_images_ family subdirectories can be placed.

image::component-dir-structure-with-assets.png[The assets subdirectory of a module that contains an images folder and an attachments folder,200]

You don't need to set the path to these predefined subdirectories in the header of your AsciiDoc files.
This is managed automatically by Antora.
****

//[#videos-dir]
//=== Video files

//Self-hosted video files are saved in [.path]_assets/videos_ in the same module where the page that references that video is located.
//Videos are inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:embed-video.adoc[AsciiDoc video macro].

////
For instance:

* Full page AsciiDoc documents go in the [.path]_pages_ directory.
* Photographs, diagrams, screenshots, and other graphics go in the [.path]_images_ directory.
* Source code snippets and terminal output go in the [.path]_examples_ directory.
* Reusable, AsciiDoc content snippets, such as product descriptions and definitions, go in the [.path]_partials_ directory.
