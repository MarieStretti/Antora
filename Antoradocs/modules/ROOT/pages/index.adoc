=== The Static Site Generator for Tech Writers

This site hosts the technical documentation for Antora.
Antora makes it easy for tech writers to create documentation and publish it to the web.
As a tech writer, you focus on authoring content in xref:asciidoc:asciidoc.adoc[AsciiDoc], Antora's content markup language.
You organize those files into a standard project structure and store them in one or more content (git) repositories.
Antora picks up your content from there and transforms it into a website.
That's all there is to it!

////
== Generator pipeline

Antora's site generator pipeline is a complete end-to-end solution for publishing.
While it can be extended, no additional scripts are needed.

Antora's generator pipeline kicks off by aggregating files from a variety of sources.
Currently, these sources can be branches of one or more git repositories and a UI bundle.

//NOTE: By leveraging Antora's open architecture, you can incorporate just about any other type of content too.

Next, Antora organizes the files into catalogs.
It then uses Asciidoctor to convert all content files to embeddable HTML and resolve links between pages.

Once conversion is complete, Antora passes the embeddable HTML as part of a UI data model to Handlebars templates provided by the UI bundle to create the web pages.

Finally, it publishes the pages and supporting content and UI assets to one or more local or remote destinations, where they can be viewed as a website.

Antora's built-in orchestration makes it very CI-friendly.
All the CI job has to do is prepare the environment and launch a single command, and out comes your site!

== Manage docs as code

With Antora, you manage *docs as code*.
That means your documentation process benefits from the same practices used to produce successful software.

Some of these practices include:

* Storing content in a version control system.
* Separating content, configuration, and presentation.
* Leveraging automation for compilation, validation, verification, and publishing.
* Reusing shared materials (DRY).

Antora helps you incorporate these practices into your documentation workflow.
As a result, your documentation is much easier to manage, maintain, and enhance.

//== Content is sovereign
== Documentation as Code

While it's considered a best practice to split source code into discrete, well-defined modules, documentation for that code often gets lumped into one massive "`book`".
This situation has brought many documentation projects to a grinding halt.

By treating *docs as code*, the documentation process can benefit from the best practices that produce successful software.
Antora helps you incorporate these practices into your documentation workflow.

Antora favors a modular approach to managing documentation.
It consists of a playbook, content repositories, a UI bundle, and the site generator pipeline, all of which are discrete parts.
//The playbook controls how Antora generates and publishes your site, but it does not own any content itself.

The separation of these domains keeps the configuration separate from content.
The content repositories just contain content.
They can be enlisted, per branch, into the site generation process.

This strategy makes it possible for content branches to be reused, substituted, deactivated, or archived.
This is a sharp contrast to many other site generators that intermix all of these concerns, making the documentation difficult to manage, maintain, and enhance.

== Where to begin

If you're just beginning your journey with Antora, you'll probably want to know xref:features.adoc[how Antora can help you].

If you're ready to set up a new documentation project, or you want to migrate an existing project to Antora, start by xref:component-structure.adoc[organizing your documentation files] into the project structure Antora expects.
You'll then need to xref:playbook:index.adoc[create a playbook] to tell Antora where to find the documentation and UI to use for your site.

If you already have a documentation component set up, and you're ready to create your first site, check that you've met Antora's xref:install:supported-platforms.adoc[system requirements], then xref:install:install-antora.adoc[install Antora], and finally xref:run-antora.adoc[generate your site] using the `antora` command.

If you want to jump into writing, learn how to use the AsciiDoc syntax to xref:page:index.adoc[make documentation pages].

If you want to dive deeper into the details of the site generator pipeline, check out xref:how-antora-works.adoc[how Antora works].

We hope you find making documentation sites with Antora enjoyable and rewarding.
Happy writing!
