Antora uses content organized into documentation components when it generates a documentation site.

== What is a documentation component?

A [.term]*documentation component* typically represents the documentation for a product, application, project, microservice, or training course.
It's a collection of files grouped into modules and families that share common metadata.
Antora can generate a site that only contains one documentation component or a site that contains as many documentation components as you require.

[#overview]
== Standard directory structure of a documentation component

Antora extracts the metadata that defines a documentation component from its component descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_) and the standardized directory structure used to store the component's source files.
//The source files of a documentation component are organized into a standard directory structure.
Antora also uses this structure to automatically assign preset behavior to the files stored in each directory.
<<fig-1>> shows an example of this standard directory structure.

At a minimum, a documentation component contains:

* a component descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_),
* a [.path]_modules_ directory,
* at least one module directory, such as [.path]_ROOT_ or a named module (that is, a module directory that you name), and
* at least one family subdirectory ([.path]_attachments_, [.path]_examples_, [.path]_images_, [.path]_pages_, or [.path]_partials_).

[#modules-dir]
=== _modules_ directory

Except for [.path]_antora.yml_, all of a component's source files must reside in the [.path]_modules_ directory.
This directory allows Antora to locate a documentation component that is stored in a repository or directory with other files, such as an application's source code.

=== Named and ROOT module directories

The [.path]_modules_ directory can contain a single module directory or as many module directories as you require.
A module directory represents a module in that documentation component.
A xref:modules.adoc[module] is a discrete bundle of content, such as text, images, and other source materials, that is usually related by concept, stage, feature, or workflow.
The directory name of a module is used as the module coordinate in a resource ID and, with the exception of the special `ROOT` module, appears in the site's output path.

The xref:modules.adoc#root-dir[_ROOT_ directory is a special module directory].
Its name doesn't appear in the site's output path.
Instead, it becomes the parent of any named modules in that component.

=== Family directories

Each module directory, whether [.path]_ROOT_ or a module you name, can contain any of the following xref:modules.adoc#family[family subdirectories]:

* xref:modules.adoc#attachments-dir[_attachments_]
* xref:modules.adoc#examples-dir[_examples_]
* xref:modules.adoc#images-dir[_images_]
* xref:modules.adoc#pages-dir[_pages_]
* xref:modules.adoc#partials-dir[_partials_]

Antora automatically assigns preset behavior to the files in these directories.
For example, AsciiDoc files in [.path]_pages_ are automatically converted to individual HTML pages.

=== Navigation file

A module can contain none, one, or numerous navigation files.
A xref:navigation:filenames-and-locations.adoc[navigation file] is an AsciiDoc file ([.path]_nav.adoc_) that is stored in the directory of the module, but not in any of the module's family subdirectories.
In order to be displayed in the xref:navigation:index.adoc[component's navigation menu], the navigation file must be xref:navigation:register-navigation-files.adoc[declared in the component descriptor].

=== _antora.yml_ file

The component descriptor file tells Antora that the contents of the repository or directory are a documentation component.
This file contains crucial metadata that's applied to all of a component's files.
See xref:component-descriptor.adoc[Component Descriptor: antora.yml] to learn about the required and optional information you can assign to a component.

//Antora easily builds and publishes documentation sites with over 60 documentation components--that are collected from even more repositories since a <<distributed,component can be distributed>>--and hundreds of component versions.

.Distributed component
[TIP]
While all of a documentation component's source files can be stored in a single repository, it isn't a requirement.
Antora can collect a component's source files from 5, 25, and even more repositories.
That means a few of a component's modules could be store in one repository, while the [.path]_examples_ directory of another module is stored in a tutorial repository that's maintained by a training team, and then that same module's pages could be stored in [.path]_pages_ directories across three different repositories.
When a documentation component's source files are stored in multiple repositories, it's referred to as a [.term]*distributed component*.
This capability is provided by the simple, but-oh-so-powerful component descriptor file, [.path]_antora.yml_.
