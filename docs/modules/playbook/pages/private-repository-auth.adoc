In order for Antora to access private repositories, you need to supply it with authentication credentials for each private repository URL you want to use.
You can pass these credentials to Antora in several ways, including the default git credential store, a custom credential store, or even your own credential manager.

First, let's review the authentication credential types Antora accepts by default: username and password pairs and personal access (OAuth) tokens.

== Credential types

Antora will authenticate with private repositories using HTTP Basic authentication.
HTTP Basic authentication requires sending credentials to the server to verify your identity.
Authentication credentials consist of either a username and password pair or a personal access (OAuth) token.

The username and password pair is typically your login to the service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) where the repository is hosted.
You can use this pair as long as you don't have two-factor authentication enabled on your account.

If you do have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your account, you must use a personal access token instead.
To create a personal access token for *GitHub*, see {url-create-token-github}[Creating a personal access token for the command line^].
To create one for *GitLab*, see {url-create-token-gitlab}[Personal access tokens^].
For *Bitbucket*, you'll need to create an {url-create-app-pass-bitbucket}[app password^] with read access to repositories.

Next, let's see how to supply these credentials to Antora's built-in credential manager via the default git credential store.

== Supply credentials using the default git credential store

By default, Antora's built-in credential manager automatically checks for credentials in the {url-credential-store}[git credential store^].
The default path for the git credential store is _$HOME/.git-credentials_, followed by _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials_ if the previous location doesn't exist.

When Antora is notified by the certain that a URL requires authentication, it will look for an entry in the credentials store that has a matching context.
If a protocol (e.g., `https`) and hostname (and, optionally, the path) are found in the credentials store, those credentials are returned to Antora's credential manager and passed on to the git server.

The credential store contains zero or more line-based entries.
The structure of each entry is expected to be as follows:

----
https://<credentials>@<hostname>
----

`<credentials>` is either a username and password pair (`username:password`) or a personal access token (`token:`).
`<hostname>` is the address of the git server (e.g., `github.com`).

You can populate the credential store interactively using the system `git` command or by editing the credential store directly.
Let's start with the interactive approach.

=== Populate the credential store interactively

You can use the `git` command to populate the credential store interactively.
This approach is especially useful since it allows you to verify that your credentials are accepted by the git server.

First, select the URL of a private repository you want to use with Antora.
Next, in your terminal, run the following command for each private repository you need to access from Antora:

 $ git config --global credential.helper store && \
   echo -n 'Repository URL: ' && read REPLY && \
   git ls-remote -h $REPLY > /dev/null

This command performs the following steps:

. Enables the git credential store globally (temporarily).
. Prompts you for the URL of a private repository.
. Communicates with the private repository, triggering a prompt for your credentials.
+
NOTE: If you aren't prompted for your credentials, it means your credentials are already stored.

. Stores the credentials in [.path]_$HOME/.git-credentials_ (and assigning it the appropriate permissions).

If this script succeeds, you can use the applicable private repositories in Antora without any further configuration.

.Restore your git configuration
****
The interactive script above altered your git settings in order to enable the credential store globally.
If you aren't using the credential store outside of Antora, run the following command to disable it again:

 $ git config --global --remove-section credential

Changing this setting does not affect how Antora uses the credential store.
It only affects the behavior of your native git client.
****

If the interactive approach didn't work for you, you can populate the credential store directly.
Let's give that a shot.

=== Populate the credential store directly

To add credentials to the git credential store directly, create the file [.path]_$HOME/.git-credentials_ and open it in your editor.
Enter the credentials for each private repository on its own line.

Here's an example entry that uses a username and password pair:

----
https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com
----

Here's an example that uses a token (pay attention to the trailing `:` after the token):

----
https://abcdefg0123456:@github.com
----

To use different credentials for a given repository, you can append a repository path (i.e., `<repo>`) to the entry to make the matching more strict.
(The `.git` file extension in the repository path is optional).

----
https://<credentials>@<hostname>/<repo>
----

Here's an example for a specific repository path:

----
https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com/octocat/Hello-World
----

To ensure this file is protected, immediately set its file permissions so it cannot be read by others.

 $ chmod 600 $HOME/.git-credentials

[#custom-credential-path]
== Specify a custom git credential store path

Instead of using the credential store at the default path(s), you can instruct Antora to look for the file in a different location using either the `--git-credentials-path` CLI option or `GIT_CREDENTIALS_PATH` environment variable.

Here's an example that uses the CLI option to specify a path relative to the playbook file:

 $ antora --git-credentials-path=./.git-credentials antora-playbook.yml

You can also specify this location directly in your playbook file under the `git` key.

.antora-playbook.yml (fragment)
[source,yaml]
----
git:
  credentials:
    path: ./.git-credentials
----

== Pass credentials via an environment variable

Instead of reading the credentials from a file, you can have Antora read the credentials directly from the environment variable named `GIT_CREDENTIALS`.
Here's an example that demonstrates the concept:

 $ export GIT_CREDENTIALS='https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com'
 $ antora antora-playbook.yml

You can even reduce this to a single line:

 $ GIT_CREDENTIALS='https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com' antora antora-playbook.yml

This strategy is most useful in a CI environment where environment variables can be secured.
It's also a quick and informal way of passing credentials to Antora when generating the site on your own machine.

When using the environment variable, multiple entries may be separated either by a comma or a newline character.
For example:

 $ GIT_CREDENTIALS='https://my-github-token:@github.com,https://oauth2:my-gitlab-token@gitlab.com' antora antora-playbook.yml

Exporting the environment variable saves you from having to type it each time you run Antora.

== Encode credentials in a URL (not recommended)

Another option for passing credentials to the credential manager is to encode them directly in the URL listed in the playbook.

WARNING: This strategy is not recommended unless you're using a placeholder to inject the real credentials, as described at the end of this section.

Antora will extract the credentials that precede the hostname (i.e., `username:password@` or `token@`) and use them to perform authentication on your behalf if requested by the server.

Here are several examples:

.antora-playbook.yml (fragment)
[source,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://GITHUB_TOKEN:@github.com:org/project-docs.git
  - url: https://oauth2:GITLAB_TOKEN@gitlab.com:org/project-docs.git
  - url: https://x-oauth-token:BITBUCKET_TOKEN@bitbucket.org:org/project-docs.git
  - url: https://USERNAME:BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD@bitbucket.org:org/project-docs.git
----

NOTE: Notice that the tokens are located in different locations in the URL depending on the git host.
See {url-oauth2-formats}[OAuth2 formats^] for more details.
If you're using a Bitbucket app password, you'll also need to include your username (using the format `USERNAME:BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD`).

The drawback of this approach is that it requires putting the credentials directly into the playbook file.
Unfortunately, Antora does not yet support resolving environment variables located in the playbook file.
However, you can emulate this behavior by using a script to substitute references to an environment variable in the playbook file with its value.

Let's assume you have the following source defined in your playbook file:

.antora-playbook.yml (fragment)
[source,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://$GITHUB_TOKEN:@github.com:org-name/project-docs.git
----

If you're using multiple private repositories that require the same credentials, you can instead define the credentials once under the `git` key as follows:

.antora-playbook.yml (fragment)
[source,yaml]
----
git:
  credentials:
    contents: https://$GITHUB_TOKEN:@github.com
----

You can then use the following script to expand the references to the environment variable, which you may run in CI prior to invoking Antora:

 $ sed -i s/\$GITHUB_TOKEN/$GITHUB_TOKEN/ antora-playbook.yml
 $ antora antora-playbook.yml

Despite this workaround, we still recommend using the credential store integration described earlier.

[#custom-manager]
== Configure a custom credential manager

The git client used by Antora, isomorphic-git, provides a {url-credential-manager-plugin}[pluggable credential manager^] for looking up authentication credentials.
Antora provides a default implementation of this plugin.
As you've seen in previous sections, this implementation assumes Antora can access the credentials directly, in plain text, either via a file or environment variable.
If this arrangement does not meet your security requirements, you can replace the built-in credential manager with your own.

To write a custom credential manager, create a JavaScript object (or class) that implements the following methods:

[source,js]
----
configure ({ config, startDir })
async fill ({ url })
async approved ({ url })
async rejected ({ url, auth })
status ({ url })
----

The method that looks up the credentials is `fill`.
It must return either a `{ username, password }` or `{ token }` data object.
The `approved` and `rejected` methods are called when the credentials are approved or rejected by the server, respectively.

The optional `configure` and `status` methods are specific to Antora, extending the capabilities of what a credential manager in isomomrphic-git typically provides.
If defined, the `configure` method is called each time Antora starts, providing an opportunity to perform initialization steps such as defining properties.
The `status` method, if available, is used by Antora to look up whether authentication was requested for a given URL.

To activate your custom credential manager, first write your implementation in a dedicated JavaScript file and register it with isomorphic-git as follows:

.custom-credential-manager.js
[source,js]
----
const git = require('isomorphic-git')

git.cores.create('antora').set('credentialManager', {
  async fill ({ url }) { ... },
  async approved ({ url }) { ... },
  async rejected ({ url, auth }) { ... },
})
----

Then pass this file to the `-r` option when running Antora:

 $ antora -r ./custom-credential-manager.js antora-playbook.yml

If you've installed Antora globally using `npm`, you may run into problems getting your custom credential manager to work.
Either you'll encounter the error `Cannot find module 'isomorphic-git'` or your custom credential manager won't be called.
To fix this problem, set the `NODE_PATH` environment variable to tell Node where to look for Antora's dependencies:

 $ NODE_PATH=$(npm -g list --parseable=true @antora/site-generator-default)/node_modules \
   antora -r ./system-git-credential-manager.js antora-playbook.yml 

The alternate solution is to install Antora locally (i.e., add the Antora packages to the dependencies in [.path]_package.json_ file and run `npm i`).

=== Get credentials from git

Git offers a command named `git credential` that serves as a simple interface for storing and retrieving credentials from system-specific helpers in the same manner as git itself.
It can also prompt the user for a username and password.
We can use this command in a custom credential manager to allow Antora to delegate to git to look up credentials (and thus integrate with the user's own git settings).

Let's start by creating a helper function that interfaces with the system git via `git credentials fill` to retrieve the credentials for a URL:

[source,js]
----
const git = require('isomorphic-git')
const { spawn } = require('child_process')
const { URL } = require('url')

function gitCredentialFill (url) {
  const { protocol, host } = new URL(url)
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const output = []
    const process = spawn('git', ['credential', 'fill'])
    process.on('close', (code) => {
      if (code) return reject(code)
      const { username, password } = output.join('\n').split('\n').reduce((acc, line) => {
        if (line.startsWith('username') || line.startsWith('password')) {
          const [ key, val ] = line.split('=')
          acc[key] = val
        }
        return acc
      }, {})
      resolve(password ? { username, password } : username ? { token: username } : undefined)
    })
    process.stdout.on('data', (data) => output.push(data.toString().trim()))
    process.stdin.write(`protocol=${protocol.slice(0, -1)}\nhost=${host}\n\n`)
  })
}
----

Next, let's create a credential manager that uses this function to retrieve the credentials:

[source,js]
----
const systemGitCredentialManager = {
  configure () {
    this.urls = []
  },
  async fill ({ url }) {
    this.urls.push(url)
    return gitCredentialFill(url)
  },
  async approved ({ url }) {},
  async rejected ({ url, auth }) {
    const data = { statusCode: 401, statusMessage: 'HTTP Basic: Access Denied' }
    const err = new Error(`HTTP Error: ${data.statusCode} ${data.statusMessage}`)
    err.name = err.code = 'HTTPError'
    err.data = data
    err.rejected = !!auth
    throw err
  },
  status ({ url }) {
    return this.urls.includes(url)
  },
}
----

Finally, we need to register the credential manager with isomorphic-git:

[source,js]
----
git.cores.create('antora').set('credentialManager', systemGitCredentialManager)
----

If we require this script when invoking Antora, Antora will delegate to the system git to fill the credentials:

 $ antora -r ./system-git-credential-manager.js antora-playbook.yml

If you run into problems, make sure to set the `NODE_PATH` environment variable as explained in the previous section.

It's left up to an exercise for the reader to store or erase the credentials based on whether they were approved or rejected by the server (hint: use the `approved` and `rejected` methods to invoke `git credential` again).

[#ssh-auth]
== SSH authentication

Since 2.0, Antora no longer supports public/private key authentication over SSH using an SSH agent.
Instead, Antora transparently converts git SSH URLs in the playbook to HTTPS URLs and uses the credential manager for authentication.
That means you can use SSH URLs and HTTPS URLs interchangeably in your playbook file, but ultimately the git client will communicate over HTTPS.
If, for some reason, this automatic translation doesn't work, you'll need to update your playbook file to use the correct HTTPS URL.
