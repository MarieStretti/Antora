= Modules

== What is a module?

A documentation component is composed of one or more modules.
A [.term]_module_ is a discrete bundle of content, including text, images, and other source materials, organized in a hierarchy of folders by content type, then by optional topic (aka tag or category) if needed.

=== Why modules?

You might be contemplating one or more of the following questions:

[%hardbreaks]
Why have modules?
Do we need all this structure?
Isn't a component enough?

One thing we've learned about documentation is that it multiplies, often quickly and unpredictably.
As more content is created and your documentation team grows, more often than not, you want to start grouping files into folders to make them easier to find and manage.
Modules allow you to group text files and their associated assets together as your documentation expands, all while preserving the xref:page:page-id.adoc#important[full capability of Antora's page ID].

Modules are also perfect when one software project is incubating a potential subproject that may spin off as its own project in the future.
It's easy to later detach a module from a component and set it up as its own documentation component.

// This section feels rather unhelpful/hand-wavy, a nice solid example will probably help structure it better but such an example is going to take time (i.e. needs to be its own issue)
// Eventually, we'll want to put together a little "Should I make this a topic folder or a module?" and/or what are some examples of topics vs modules.

//Modules are also useful for grouping all the content related to a feature that you'll retire in a few versions.

== Module overview

A documentation component can contain as many modules as you need or as few as one.
If you only create one module in a component, we highly recommend that you name it _ROOT_ because Antora automatically applies component-level URLs to the files in this module.
The following figure illustrates a documentation component with a few example folders and files added for context.
All of a component's modules must be stored in [.path]_modules_.

Let's examine the role the _ROOT_ module and the requirements of the subdirectories a module can contain.

[#root-dir]
== ROOT module

The [.term]_ROOT_ module contains all the content that's directly associated with the documentation component itself.

image::root-dir-structure.png[,200]

When the pages in the ROOT module are published, these pages are promoted a level above any other modules`' pages in that component's URL.
(You can see an example of a ROOT page's URL in <<pages-dir,pages>>.)
The directory name, ROOT, must be entered in all uppercase letters.
When used in a page or resource reference, it must be entered in all uppercase letters.

Small documentation components may never need more than a ROOT module.
However, if your project grows, you can easily add more modules and gradually redistribute the content without having to restructure the project.
So while the extra structure seems like overkill now, in the long run, you'll be glad you gave your content the space to grow.

The ROOT module, as well as any other modules you create, should include the appropriate content type subdirectory when a module uses that content type.

For instance:

* AsciiDoc documents go in the [.path]_pages_ folder.
* Images go in the [.path]_assets/images_ folder.
* Code snippets go in the [.path]_examples_ folder.

Each one of these folders can have an arbitrary depth of topic folders that are used to group files to make them easier for you to manage and navigate.

When a writer is working on the content, the module becomes the writer's primary workspace.
The writer doesn't have to look elsewhere to find files that belong together.
This arrangement mirrors how software developers work on source code.

Let's look at each of these directories and their content type in more detail.

[#assets-dir]
== Assets

Any attachment or image files associated with a module must be stored in the corresponding content or media type subdirectory under that module's [.path]_assets_ directory.

image::assets-dir.svg[,260]

The subdirectory names automatically recognized by Antora and associated to the corresponding AsciiDoc macros are:

* [.path]_assets/attachments_
* [.path]_assets/images_
//* [.path]_assets/videos_

You don't need to set the path to these predefined subdirectories in the header of your AsciiDoc files.
This is managed automatically by Antora.

[#attachments-dir]
=== Attachment files

An attachment is a resource that you want your user to download, such as a PDF or a ZIP archive of a sample project.
Attachment files are saved in [.path]_assets/attachments_.
A link to an attachment is created in a page using the xref:asciidoc:link-attachment.adoc[AsciiDoc link macro].

[#images-dir]
=== Image files

Image files are saved in [.path]_assets/images_.
Supported image file formats include:

* PNG
* JPG
* SVG
* GIF (static and animated)

Images are inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:insert-image.adoc[AsciiDoc image macro] (block or inline).

//[#videos-dir]
//=== Video files

//Self-hosted video files are saved in [.path]_assets/videos_ in the same module where the page that references that video is located.
//Videos are inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:embed-video.adoc[AsciiDoc video macro].

=== Large files and GitLab / GitHub

If your documentation component contains large asset files, we don't recommend that you store them in a regular GitLab or GitHub repository.
Instead, you should either host them in a binary repository such as Bintray or S3, or use git LFS (Large File Storage).

[#examples-dir]
== Example files

The [.path]_examples_ directory contains non-AsciiDoc file types, such as source code or data values.
An example is inserted into a standard page using the xref:asciidoc:include-example.adoc[AsciiDoc include directive and the example's resource ID].

[#pages-dir]
== Pages

AsciiDoc document files that are destined to become xref:page:index.adoc#standard[standard pages] are stored in the [.path]_pages_ folder of a module.
These files are converted to HTML and automatically published as individual pages in the generated site.

image::pages-dir.svg[,260]

When the pages in the ROOT module are published, these pages are promoted a level above any other modules`' pages in that component's URL.

Let's say the component illustrated above is the documentation for your newest software product, Hyper Lemur.
What would the URL for [.path]_modules/ROOT/pages/deploy.adoc_ look like?

//.URL for deploy.adoc page in ROOT module
image::root-page-url.svg[ROOT module page URL,role=grow-x]

The xref:playbook:configure-site.adoc#configure-url[base URL is set in the playbook].
The component name, in this case _hyperlemur_, is set in the xref:component-descriptor.adoc#name-key[component descriptor].
The page name segment is the basename of the AsciiDoc file.
Notice that the name of the module, ROOT, isn't in the URL.
Files that are stored directly in the [.path]_ROOT_ folder are published at the root of the component.

In contrast, pages that are stored in other modules will be preceded by the name of the module.
Let's see what the URL for [.path]_modules/a-module/pages/user-management.adoc_ would look like.

//.URL for user-management.adoc page in a-module
image::module-page-url.svg[Module page URL,role=grow-x]

The module name is the name of the module directory where that page is stored.

* xref:page:create-standard-page.adoc[Create a standard page]

[#partials-dir]
=== Partial AsciiDoc files

xref:page:index.adoc#partial[Partials] are AsciiDoc files.
They're stored in the [.path]_partials_ directory in a module.
//(or [.path]_pages/_partials_) in the same module as the standard pages that use them.
A partial is inserted into a standard page using the xref:asciidoc:include-partial.adoc[AsciiDoc include directive and the partial's resource ID].
