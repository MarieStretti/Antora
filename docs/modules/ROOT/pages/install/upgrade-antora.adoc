On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to upgrade the Antora CLI.
* [x] How to upgrade the default Antora site generator.

IMPORTANT: The CLI version and default site generator version must be the same.
If you follow these instructions when you upgrade, the versions will stay in sync.

== Upgrade the CLI

To upgrade the CLI, open a terminal and type:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ npm install -g @antora/cli@{page-component-version}

The Node package manager (npm) will automatically install the latest version of the CLI.

[TIP]
====
If you installed the CLI and the default site generator globally, you can upgrade both of them with the same command.

[subs=attributes+]
 $ npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default@{page-component-version}

====

.npm tips
****
To list the Node packages that are installed globally, type the following command in your terminal:

 $ npm ls -g --depth=0

If the CLI and site generator are installed globally, you'll see them listed in the terminal output.
The output will also show the CLI and site generator versions (where `.x` represents the latest patch number).
The versions of these two packages should match.

To list the Node packages you have installed locally in a project, go to that directory and type:

 $ npm ls --depth=0

== Upgrade the default site generator

The method for upgrading the default site generator depends on whether it is installed globally or inside a playbook project.

If it's installed globally, the command to upgrade it is:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ npm install -g @antora/site-generator-default@{page-component-version}

If you installed the site generator in a playbook project, update the version number of the site generator in the package file.

. Switch to the playbook project directory.

. Open the [.path]_package.json_ file.

. Change the version number of the site generator.
+
[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@antora/site-generator-default": "{page-component-version}"
  }
}
----

. Save the file.

. Upgrade the site generator by running the `npm install` command.

 $ npm install

TIP: If you're using yarn instead of npm, run the `yarn` command after updating  [.path]_package.json_.
It may be necessary to pass the `--force` flag to force an update.

You've now upgraded to the latest version of the Antora CLI and default site generator.
